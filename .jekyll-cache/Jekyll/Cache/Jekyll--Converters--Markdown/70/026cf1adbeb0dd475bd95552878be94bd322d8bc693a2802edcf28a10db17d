            <div class="excerpt">Hey, I'm Jef, owner of the site. I'm a software engineer. I'm an enthusiastic teacher and lifelong leaner. I'm a volunteer mentor for aspiring tech students in web technologies. I earned my BS in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire Univeristy in 2021.</div>
            <div class="excerpt">Here's a little extra on me. I began my career in tech at 35, earning entry into a field where I was already older than a lot of senior devs. It's been quite a journey, full of challenges as well as chances to develop skills that translate across many fields.</div>
            <div class="excerpt">I'm also a passionate mental health advocate. I hope to encourage others as I share experiences from my own struggles with substance abuse in an honest effort to help heal all that goes along with the psychology of battling addiction.</div>
