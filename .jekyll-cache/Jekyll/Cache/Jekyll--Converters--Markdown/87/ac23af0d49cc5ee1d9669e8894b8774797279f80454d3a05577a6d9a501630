I"<p>In one of the lowest periods of my struggle with addiction, I wondered two things.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Why did I spend so much time doing things I really didn’t want to be doing?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why did I spend so much time with people I really didn’t want to be with?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Time is the real currency in life. That’s why time is “spent”. Who we spend our time with and what we spend our time doing says a lot about what we value.</p>

<p>How many of us have lost ourselves trying to make an unworkable relationship work? Or worked 60-hour weeks trying to get promoted doing work we don’t enjoy? In time, what we once felt were purposeful and worthy pursuits are sometimes proven misguided or fruitless endeavors.</p>

<p>Ask yourself, “Is this what I want or need to be doing with my time”? “Is this worth the time and life energy I’m trading for it”? Or my favorite, “Is the juice worth the squeeze”?</p>

<p>At times, we must all do things we don’t enjoy; to meet our obligations, pay the bills, etc. But more often, we take for granted the agency we have in our lives and accept less than what we want or need.</p>

<p>You have an incredible capacity to affect change. And you have the most valuable resource there is; time.</p>
