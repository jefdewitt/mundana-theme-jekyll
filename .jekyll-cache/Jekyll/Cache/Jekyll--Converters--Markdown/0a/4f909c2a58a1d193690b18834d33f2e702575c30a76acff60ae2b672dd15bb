I"¯<p>According to the National Institutes of Health, ten percent of Americans have struggled with substance abuse at some point in their lives (NIH, 2015). Thatâ€™s over 30 million people. Iâ€™m one of them.</p>

<p>My own journey to openly discuss matters like addiction and therapy was a bumpy one. But I built some important skills in getting sober which translate well to professional success. I aim to de-stigmatize mental health discussions in the workplace as well as help anyone experiencing struggles like mine. Any and all feedback is sincerely appreciated.</p>

<h2 id="embrace-struggling">Embrace Struggling</h2>

<p>I volunteer as a mentor at Code Louisville where the mission is â€œto provide quality training and support to help residents of Louisville enter software development careers at no chargeâ€ (Code Louisville, n.d.). Itâ€™s a mission thatâ€™s placed more than 500 graduates in technology roles, reports David A. Mann, Digital Editor for Louisville Business First (Mann, 2020).</p>

<p>But thereâ€™s a constant at Code Louisville I want to address: students hide their struggles.</p>

<h4 id="why-hide-our-struggles">Why Hide Our Struggles?</h4>

<p>Hiding our struggles amounts to feeling shame on some level. We think that we shouldnâ€™t be struggling, or at least struggling this much; that itâ€™s a sign of ineptitude. Imposter Syndrome is so common in tech that I havenâ€™t met a dev who hasnâ€™t experienced it. Itâ€™s practically a mental health issue. But whatever the reason for choosing to silently struggle, itâ€™s an unnecessary barrier between yourself and learning.</p>

<p>Because thatâ€™s the bottom line: hiding our struggle slows our learning. Of course, we struggle as we learn something new. And the irony here is that by not asking for help when we need it, weâ€™re making learning harder.</p>

<h4 id="the-importance-of-transparency">The Importance of Transparency</h4>

<p>LinkedIn isnâ€™t necessarily where we share our struggles. Itâ€™s more like a highlight reel for our careers. Itâ€™s where we share our accomplishments, the things weâ€™ve poured their hearts and minds into. And it isnâ€™t just self-serving; our stories can motivate others, inspire them.</p>

<p>But our struggles should be celebrated too.</p>

<p>Learning to embrace struggling represents an enormous shift in perspective. It means being transparent about feelings we all share, like being embarrassed to ask for help. It means youâ€™re holding yourself accountable and prioritizing learning over ego.</p>

<p>Embracing struggling means no longer seeing challenges as negatives that take away from, rather as positives that contribute to your success. You know youâ€™re honing skills and growing when you struggle. Itâ€™s a growth opportunity, but only if you view it that way.</p>

<h4 id="career-implications">Career Implications</h4>

<p>It wasnâ€™t until I changed how I viewed my struggle with addiction that I became sober. Rather than see my struggle as a weakness, I learned to draw strength from not giving in, and from sharing it with others. They hold me accountable. The more I share about that part of my life, the more I thrive.</p>

<p>That brings us full circle. When my students finally get around to asking for help (usually near the end of the term), they learn more. Their performance improves. And learning to ask for help is one of the most important skills there are. Admitting when you struggle and asking for help moves you forward. It gets you unstuck.</p>

<h4 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h4>

<p>If anyone out there is struggling, if youâ€™re doubting yourself, if youâ€™re wondering if this is the right path for you, keep going. Youâ€™re in good company.</p>

<p>Asking for help or admitting you donâ€™t know something doesnâ€™t mean you arenâ€™t clever or â€˜donâ€™t have what it takesâ€™. In fact, it indicates precisely the opposite.</p>

<p>How do you respond to struggling in your life/career?</p>
