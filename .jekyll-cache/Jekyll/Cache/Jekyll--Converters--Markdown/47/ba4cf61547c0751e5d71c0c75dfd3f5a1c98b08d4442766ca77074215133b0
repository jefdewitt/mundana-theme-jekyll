I"Ë<p>I grew up not knowing how to talk about a lot of things. Especially feelings.</p>

<p>I was taught that itâ€™s ok to show emotion in sports. If my team won or lost, then I was allowed to cry. The rest of the time I was told to â€œwalk it offâ€ or â€œkeep it togetherâ€.</p>

<p>Later, when I experienced tough times, I felt crazy when I couldnâ€™t convey how I felt. I felt misunderstood. I couldnâ€™t relate to people. I isolated myself. I turned to unhealthy coping strategies to bury my uncomfortable feelings.</p>

<p>This way of life became destructive to relationships. I was a sweet, nurturing partner when I felt secure. Then I would detach, tune out, and become unavailable when I felt insecure.</p>

<p>After enough hurt feelings, enough failed relationships, I was humbled enough to want help. I turned to therapy; a sarcastic, witty therapist who held my feet to the fire. Our conversations revealed harsh truths. I grew up, emotionally.</p>

<p>I learned tactics for remaining present with people even when Iâ€™m uncomfortable. I learned itâ€™s ok to ask for time to think, to say youâ€™re not alright. I learned that leaning on others and being vulnerable isnâ€™t weak.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s wisdom in knowing how to speak about how you feel. But these skills arenâ€™t what we learn in school. We learn them on the fly. Theyâ€™re forged in the fire of live relationships, often with people getting hurt in our education process.</p>

<p>Be brave and share how you feel with those you care about. Itâ€™s an act that requires choosing and prioritizing yourself. Your experience matters as much as everyone elseâ€™s.</p>

<p>Besides, thereâ€™s way more room outside than inside of you. Use that space to unburden yourself.</p>
