I"I<p>How you and your partner define their needs is crucial to meeting them.</p>

<p>It’s awfully hard to hit a bullseye when you’re aiming at the wrong target. You might luck up and hit it. But it’s a way more efficient plan to first identify and aim (define) at what you’re trying to hit.</p>

<p>It’s not hard to take for granted what we think our partners mean when we learn about their needs. Do we actually understand them correctly, though?</p>

<p>A rupture or disconnection can happen when we make assumptions. And our egos often get in the way of we’re already putting in effort but we’re not recognized or appreciated.</p>

<p>If we remain curious about our partners and clarify how they define having their needs met, we have a much better chance to hit what we’re shooting for.</p>

<p>Aim wisely, my friends.</p>
