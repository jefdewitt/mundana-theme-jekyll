  <p>I was never addicted to one thing, I was addicted to filling a void within myself with things other than my own love.</p>

<p>As an addict in recovery, this hits me on levels. Frankly, filling the void with substances was the only thing that made me happy for a time.</p>

<p>After I got sober, my life got better. But the void was still there.</p>

<p>I tried filling the void with a career. Maybe success would fill the void. It didnâ€™t.</p>

<p>Then, I fell in love. For a time, it seemed to be just what the doctor ordered. It wasnâ€™t.</p>

<h4 id="love-worthy">Love Worthy</h4>

<p>Years of inner work led me to realize that I didnâ€™t feel worthy of love. That I didnâ€™t think I deserved to be happy. That I thought I had to earn these things constantly or fall behind and never catch up.</p>

<p>After this breakthrough, I wept for an entire weekend.</p>

<p>Finally, I made changes to the way I understood love. Itâ€™s not earned. Itâ€™s freely given. I learned about acceptance. I practiced self-validation. I integrated all the parts of me, the good as well as the bad, into a whole person. And I still practice accepting who that person is every day. Thatâ€™s self-love.</p>

<p>External sources only temporarily fill the void. To fill it lastingly, it must come from within. It takes self-awareness. It takes practice. It takes accepting love freely, no strings attached.</p>
