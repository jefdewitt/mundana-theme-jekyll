I"ö<p>According to the National Institutes of Health, <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/10-percent-us-adults-have-drug-use-disorder-some-point-their-lives" target="_blank">ten percent of Americans have struggled with substance abuse</a> at some point in their lives (NIH, 2015). Thatâ€™s over 30 million people. Iâ€™m one of them.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve written this post to promote normalizing discussions around substance abuse and addiction in the workplace. Why? Because I was once afraid to talk about it and maybe others are too. Admittedly, this is a little self-serving but itâ€™s an honest effort to help heal all that goes along with the psychology of battling addiction.</p>

<h4 id="why-worry">Why Worry?</h4>

<p>I was worried about what other people might think. I kept my sobriety under wraps with people until I felt comfortable around them. My rule was only to reveal as much as I could afford to be judged on. Because letâ€™s face it, some people judge pretty hard.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a provocative topic. People respond in interesting ways.</p>

<p>â€œOh, so did you have a problem?â€ Duh.</p>

<p>â€œI really donâ€™t drink that often.â€ I am the last person with any right to judge.</p>

<p>â€œMaybe I should stop drinking too.â€ Hey, if you want to talk about it, great. But I wonâ€™t be trying to persuade you.</p>

<h4 id="embracing-transparency">Embracing Transparency</h4>

<p>On dating apps, I include my sobriety at the top. I used to be shy â€“ I thought it would scare people off. Now, thatâ€™s exactly why Iâ€™m open about it. The right people stick around. And I get the sense a lot of people like the idea of a more stable partner.</p>

<p>Let me be very clear, Iâ€™m not suggesting those things go hand-in-hand for everyoneâ€™s experience, but they did with me.</p>

<p>The results have been a lot more positive than I anticipated. I get reactions from people specifically from that portion of my profile; more so than any other part (and Iâ€™ve got killer jokes on there too). I like to think my admission conveys transparency, integrity, and honesty.</p>

<h4 id="career-implications">Career Implications</h4>

<p>The truth is, Iâ€™m still sort of shy about it in my professional life. Unless someone asks me or I get to know them well, it generally doesnâ€™t come up.</p>

<p>I have long worried that a potential employer would see my history of struggling with substance abuse as a giant red flag. But today I have over a half-decade of sobriety under my belt. Iâ€™m proud of that. I have successfully modified my behavior. I have come to be honest with myself in ways that translate well to accountability and accepting even difficult feedback in constructive ways.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t take sick days to nurse hangovers. I show up and I work hard to prove I belong at the table. My ego gets checked at the door.</p>

<h4 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h4>

<p>Because thatâ€™s another thing: Hiding this stuff makes me feel ashamed. And that feeds a toxic mindset that I donâ€™t belong. In the past, Iâ€™ve leveraged this to push myself harder. I worked to â€˜make upâ€™ for what I had done, to amend my past and atone for my mistakes.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m trying not to feel that way anymore. Those mistakes helped make me who I am today. Iâ€™m actually grateful for them. And because of how I chose to respond to my struggles, Iâ€™m a better employee, a better coworker, and a better person.</p>

<p>Do you see past struggles with addiction as a red flag?</p>
