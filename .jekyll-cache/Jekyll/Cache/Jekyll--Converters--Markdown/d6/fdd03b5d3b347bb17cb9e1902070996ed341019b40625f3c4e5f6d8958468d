<p>Rarely are our paths smooth and straight. More often than not, weâ€™re faced with setbacks that challenge and discourage us. It seems like a rite-of-passage; we have to pay our dues, we have to take our licks.</p>

<p>Progress isnâ€™t always linear. Sometimes itâ€™s sideways. Sometimes we take a step (or three) backwards. How we choose to respond is the only real control we have in our careers and in our lives. This is why attitude matters.</p>

<p>In a world full of injustice and inequality itâ€™s not hard to get down. Negativity can even appear to be intellectual. As if being positive is a sign that your head is buried in the sand. After all, ignorance is bliss â€“ so you must be ignorant.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve had my share of setbacks along the way. In 2013, I considered going to school before teaching myself web development. An academic advisor deterred me from pursuing a computer science degree. He advised it was too â€œmath heavyâ€ for me based on my academic resume.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve had employers scoff at my lack of experience. Others have implied that I wouldnâ€™t last in my position. It was only a matter of time before I failed. Iâ€™ve even heard the argument that my soft skills were too polished to be a successful software developer. They implied that these are mutually exclusive skill sets.</p>

<p>I felt like an imposter at times. I felt embarrassed. I have felt unable to measure up. But I have made it a priority to improve my attitude by changing the way I thought about the challenges I faced. I credit therapy for helping me.</p>

<p>In Manâ€™s Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl wrote â€œEverything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms â€“ to choose oneâ€™s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose oneâ€™s own wayâ€ (Frankl, V. 1962).</p>

<p>Itâ€™s up to us to decide how we interpret what we experience.</p>

<p>Positivity isnâ€™t taught in schools. Itâ€™s learned. Although itâ€™s considered a â€˜softâ€™ skill, itâ€™s pretty hard to keep up. Especially in the face of endless news cycles, a pandemic, and lifeâ€™s curveballs.</p>

<p>Staying positive in the types of situations I mentioned earlier isnâ€™t easy. Having thick skin can help, but embracing positivity is more than not letting the bad stuff in. Itâ€™s <em>seeing the good in the bad</em>. And it requires working at it and building muscle behind it. It means choosing it over and over until it becomes reflexive.</p>

<p>How do you stay positive in the face of challenges?</p>
