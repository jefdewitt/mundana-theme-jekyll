I"¿<p>Therapy is a funny subject. Some think itâ€™s something of a last resort. Like you only go to therapy once the proverbial excrement has hit the fan. Itâ€™s where you finally turn to when a relationship fails. Or when you experience a loss and have tried other options without success.</p>

<p>Some believe itâ€™s intended to â€˜fixâ€™ things. You go for a while, process whatever is ailing you and then youâ€™re done. While I donâ€™t agree with the â€˜fixingâ€™ part, I see merit in seeking therapy to help process gridlocked situations and emotions.</p>

<p>Admittedly, my background in therapy is a bit extensive now. Iâ€™ve been going for over three-and-a-half years. It is the most profound decision of my life. Let me explain why.</p>

<h4 id="the-power-of-therapy">The Power of Therapy</h4>

<p>Our thoughts, behaviors, and beliefs are the product of programming weâ€™ve received over our lifetimes. The sources for these programs are our families, friends, institutions, our communities, as well as things like social media and art. Therapy offers the opportunity to raise awareness of these programs up to the conscious level.</p>

<p>That may sound a bit woo-woo but this programming is informing what we do, whether weâ€™re aware of it or not.</p>

<p>The real value in therapy is in gaining awareness of these programs.  Only then can we take conscious steps to evaluate whether theyâ€™re serving to meet our needs or not. This give us the chance to alter or replace them.</p>

<p>It sounds kind of simple. And maybe it is. But that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s easy. It requires a sort of ruthless honesty with yourself. Not a mean or hyper-critical honesty, but an unflinching, unvarnished look at what actions you are choosing.</p>

<p>This kind of honesty can help identify root causes for behaviors. Because in the end, every behavior is a need trying to get met.  You begin to understand why youâ€™re choosing responses when you are honest with yourself. You gain better perspective on meeting your own needs.</p>

<p>If needs arenâ€™t actually getting met, itâ€™s time to re-evaluate the behavior. This opens the door to healthier, more effective strategies.</p>

<h4 id="the-real-work-of-therapy">The Real Work of Therapy</h4>

<p>Real therapy requires you to do work.</p>

<p>Out of pocket expenses can add up. Then, thereâ€™s the time involved. We all have busy lives. Sometimes it can be hard to find an extra hour here and there.</p>

<p>Let me be real here: Being vulnerable with a complete stranger can be scary. Itâ€™s not always easy to reveal deep truths about ourselves. Especially the unsavory bits, opening ourselves up to perceived judgement. Although, a good therapist is a safe place to do this.</p>

<p>It can be therapeutic to talk to someone how you feel but to gain insight and healing you must do the work. This means raising your self-awareness about your programs, your beliefs, thought patterns, and behaviors. This means researching the ideas that come up in therapy. Sometimes thereâ€™s homework: reading books, online articles. And always trying to live mindful of the insights gained during session work.</p>

<h4 id="career-implications">Career Implications</h4>

<p>Insight into motivations and decision-making has real benefits in the office too. We all have relationships weâ€™re trying to manage. Understanding ourselves leads to understanding others better, which only leads to better outcomes. Said in a facile way, this amounts to better performance, better communication, better productivity.</p>

<p>In therapy and in my career as a software engineer, I approach problems with the same basic questions in mind: What block of code is running? What is it trying to accomplish?</p>

<h4 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h4>

<p>Thereâ€™s no manual for mental health.</p>

<p>We more-or-less have to figure out how to manage ever increasing demands on our time in an increasingly complex world. Itâ€™s not easy. Weâ€™re not taught this in school.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we donâ€™t have to do this on our own. If you or someone you know can use more information finding a therapist, reach out to the folks running Psychology Today <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists">here</a>.</p>
