  <p>â€œIf your dreams donâ€™t scare you, they arenâ€™t big enough.â€ â€“ Muhammad Ali</p>

<p>Dreams about what we want in life should be big. Thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re called dreams and not reasonable expectations.</p>

<p>I have plenty of dreams that live only in my own head. They are safe there. Free from ridicule. And there, theyâ€™re actually not scary to me. They only exist within me, away from the judgment of others.</p>

<p>But these dreams are, in fact, big. Theyâ€™re outlandish. Theyâ€™re absurd. They involve accomplishing incredible things; things Iâ€™ve never even attempted before. Things I have zero experience doing.</p>

<p>Why donâ€™t they scare me, then?</p>

<p>I recently found out why.</p>

<p>Two of my close friends and I had coffee recently. We discussed our dreams of where we wanted to be in life five years from now.</p>

<p>I wonâ€™t repeat my response here. Iâ€™m not ready for the shame of public embarrassment I would feel from the ten people who may actually read this post.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, one of my friends laughed in my face. It was a beautiful reaction, actually. Rather than get offended, I felt vindicated.</p>

<p>Heâ€™s a good friend. Good friends hold you accountable. Theyâ€™re honest with you even when it might hurt. Especially when it hurts. Thatâ€™s when some people water down their feedback. Good friends give it to you full-flavored.</p>

<p>It showed me that this is the caliber of dream I should have. It scared me to reveal it. Albeit, it stung to have it laughed at. But only a little. It felt good too.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t let the fear of what others think curb your dreams. If you do, you might reach your dreams but still not actually get what you want.</p>

<p>Fear can be an ally. It can help show you the way. It can even show you when youâ€™re being too reasonable.</p>

<p>Dream out loud. Get laughed at. Dream so big that youâ€™re afraid of what others will think. At least then you know youâ€™re dreaming big enough.</p>
