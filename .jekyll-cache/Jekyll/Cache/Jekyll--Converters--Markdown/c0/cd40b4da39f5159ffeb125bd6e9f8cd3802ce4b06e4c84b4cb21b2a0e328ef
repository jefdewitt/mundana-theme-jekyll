<p>Dreams about what we want in life should be big. That’s why they’re called dreams and not reasonable expectations.</p>

<p>I have plenty of dreams that live only in my own head. They are safe there. Free from ridicule. And there, they’re actually not scary to me. They only exist within me, away from the judgment of others.</p>

<p>But these dreams are, in fact, big. They’re outlandish. They’re absurd. They involve accomplishing incredible things; things I’ve never even attempted before. Things I have zero experience doing.</p>

<p>Why don’t they scare me, then?</p>

<p>I recently found out why.</p>

<p>Two of my close friends and I had coffee recently. We discussed our dreams of where we wanted to be in life five years from now.</p>

<p>I won’t repeat my response here. I’m not ready for the shame of public embarrassment I would feel from the ten people who may actually read this post.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, one of my friends laughed in my face. It was a beautiful reaction, actually. Rather than get offended, I felt vindicated.</p>

<p>He’s a good friend. Good friends hold you accountable. They’re honest with you even when it might hurt. Especially when it hurts. That’s when some people water down their feedback. Good friends give it to you full-flavored.</p>

<p>It showed me that this is the caliber of dream I should have. It scared me to reveal it. Albeit, it stung to have it laughed at. But only a little. It felt good too.</p>

<p>Don’t let the fear of what others think curb your dreams. If you do, you might reach your dreams but still not actually get what you want.</p>

<p>Fear can be an ally. It can help show you the way. It can even show you when you’re being too reasonable.</p>

<p>Dream out loud. Get laughed at. Dream so big that you’re afraid of what others will think. At least then you know you’re dreaming big enough.</p>
