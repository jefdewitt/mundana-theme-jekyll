Therapy is a funny subject. Some think it’s a last resort. Like you only go to therapy once the proverbial excrement has hit the fan. It’s where you finally turn to when a relationship fails. Or when you experience a loss and have tried other options without success.

Some believe it’s intended to fix things. You go for a while, process whatever is ailing you, and then you’re done. While I don’t agree with the ‘fixing’ part, I see merit in processing gridlocked situations and emotions through therapy. 

I’ve been active in therapy for over three-and-a-half years now. You won’t find a bigger proponent. It is the most profound decision of my life. Let me explain why.

#### Unconscious Programming

The way we interpret and respond to the world is through programs running in our heads. We get these programs from our communities, our institutions, our parents. We’re taught what’s right and wrong. 

Often these programs run without us noticing. We simply react to a situation the way we usually do; like when a spouse is moody and you wind up arguing. Your partner says something that triggers the response to stand up for yourself; an action ingrained in you from childhood. Rather than show empathy, you fight back. This happens without thinking. But is it helpful?

The value of therapy is in gaining awareness of these programs. It’s taking conscious steps to evaluate whether they’re serving to meet our needs or not. Are my responses helpful? Because they are the only thing we can control.

#### The Power of Therapy

That may sound a bit woo-woo but this programming is informing what we do, whether we’re aware of it or not.

It's simple, yes. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy. It requires a sort of ruthless honesty with yourself. Not a mean or hyper-critical honesty, but an unflinching, unvarnished look at what actions you are choosing. 

This kind of honesty can help identify root causes for behaviors. Because in the end, every behavior is a need trying to get met.  You begin to understand why you’re choosing responses when you are honest with yourself. You gain a better perspective on meeting your own needs. 

If needs aren’t actually getting met, it’s time to re-evaluate the behavior. This opens the door to healthier, more effective strategies.

#### The Real Work of Therapy

Therapy requires you to do work.

There’s the time involved. We all have busy lives. It can be hard to find an extra hour here and there.

Being vulnerable can be scary. It’s not always easy to reveal deep truths about ourselves. Especially the unsavory bits, opening ourselves up to perceived judgment. Although, a good therapist is a safe place to do this.

Let me be real here: The benefit is in the work. This means committing to new ways of thinking and acting. It can be therapeutic to talk to someone about how you feel, but it may not be enough. You have to do the homework; research the ideas, practice the lessons; field test what you learn.

#### Career Implications

Insight into motivations and decision-making has professional benefits too. We have office relationships we’re trying to manage. Understanding ourselves leads to a better understanding of others, which only leads to better outcomes. This amounts to better performance, better communication, better productivity. 

In therapy and in my career as a software engineer, I approach problems with the same basic questions in mind: What block of code is running? What is it trying to accomplish?

#### The Takeaway

Therapy is about breaking old patterns. It’s about awareness. It requires studying yourself. Again, it’s simple but it’s not easy.

Fortunately, we don’t have to do this on our own. If you or someone you know can use more information finding a therapist, reach out to the folks running Psychology Today [here](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists).
