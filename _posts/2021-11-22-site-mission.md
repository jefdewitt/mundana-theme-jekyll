I am a software engineer, a mental health advocate, and an imperfectionist. 

I champion struggling and imperfection. You don’t get strong from going to the gym and only doing what’s comfortable. You have to push yourself. And if you wait until the timing is just right to do something, you better get real, real comfortable. Reasons to put things off grow like wildflowers. 

#### Just To Put It Out There 

My journey is about transparency. It’s a quest to cope with those very human qualities of regret and shame by showing my imperfection. In doing that, I’d like to find community. I’ll settle for just utter authenticity and sincerity; no longer concealing or denying those needs.

#### My Hope

Naturally, after years of therapy and half-a-decade of sobriety, I take my mental health very seriously. I work hard at those things. They’ve taken a lifetime to develop and strengthen. 

I’m showing up now to help anyone who needs to read these words. Maybe someone can find courage or comfort in identifying with my experience too. That’s my hope. 

What’s become clear is that hiding the unsavory bits of my journey -- battling addiction and struggling with mental health -- has had implications beyond just my home life. It contributed to a more generalized mindset that negatively impacted my confidence, my career, and my relationships.

I don’t know where this path forward now leads. But it’s a path built on being as honest and transparent as I know how. I look forward to finding out where it takes us.
