Resumes showcase our experience, skills, and education; the highlights of our careers. Distilling our academic lives into degrees and institutions. We show examples of our competence, resourcefulness, cleverness, and accomplishments.

It’s where “I went back to school in my 40’s” becomes “I am a demonstrable lifelong learner”. 

The point is to sell yourself, right? 

#### The Personal Level

What do you _not_ put on a resume? Overcoming substance abuse. 

Is it because it’s too personal? Does addiction connote a flaw in character or discipline? Is it too uncomfortable to talk about?

But for those in recovery, addiction is only half the story. What gets missed here are the skills gained. Modifying behavior over the long term is not an easy thing to do. Improving yourself (i.e., surviving) through accepting hard truths is a critical skill. If being able to change a way of life and unhelpful personality traits isn’t a success story, I don’t know what is. 

My fight to get sober taught me the importance of healthy mindsets. This developed a deep curiosity toward understanding human connection. And it required improving the quality of personal and professional relationships.

Talking about addiction, mental health struggles, lack of confidence, and shame helps me own these feelings. Not doing so leads to being furtive, afraid to speak up, and leaving important decisions to those who are more ‘qualified’. In this way, it is 100% relevant to professional success.

#### I’m An Addict

I’m biased. I’m in recovery from addiction. But I stand behind my conviction that living in recovery is a lifestyle full of marketable skills that translate across many fields. 

Accepting the realities of substance abuse means taking ownership. It means accepting responsibility and accountability. It means living by example.

How do you view those living in recovery?
