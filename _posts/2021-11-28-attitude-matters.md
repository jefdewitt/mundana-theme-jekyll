Rarely are our paths smooth and straight. More often than not, we’re faced with setbacks that challenge and discourage us. It seems like a rite-of-passage; we have to pay our dues, we have to take our licks. 

Progress isn’t always linear. Sometimes it’s sideways. Sometimes we take a step (or three) backwards. How we choose to respond is the only real control we have in our careers and in our lives. This is why attitude matters.

In a world full of injustice and inequality it’s not hard to get down. Negativity can even appear to be intellectual. As if being positive is a sign that your head is buried in the sand. After all, ignorance is bliss -- so you must be ignorant.

#### A Litany of Setbacks

I’ve had my share of setbacks along the way. In 2013, I considered going to school before teaching myself web development. An academic advisor deterred me from pursuing a computer science degree. He advised it was too “math heavy” for me based on my academic resume. 

I’ve had employers scoff at my lack of experience. Others have implied that I wouldn’t last in my position. It was only a matter of time before I failed. I’ve even heard the argument that my soft skills were too polished to be a successful software developer. They implied that these are mutually exclusive skill sets. 

I felt like an imposter at times. I felt embarrassed. I have felt unable to measure up. But I have made it a priority to improve my attitude by changing the way I thought about the challenges I faced. I credit therapy for helping me. 

#### The Strength of Positivity

In Man’s Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl wrote "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way" (Frankl, V. 1962). 

It’s up to us to decide how we interpret what we experience. 

Positivity isn’t taught in schools. It’s learned. Although it’s considered a ‘soft’ skill, it’s pretty hard to keep up. Especially in the face of endless news cycles, a pandemic, and life's curveballs.

Staying positive in the types of situations I mentioned earlier isn’t easy. Having thick skin can help, but embracing positivity is more than not letting the bad stuff in. It’s _seeing the good in the bad_. And it requires working at it and building muscle behind it. It means choosing it over and over until it becomes reflexive.

How do you stay positive in the face of challenges?
