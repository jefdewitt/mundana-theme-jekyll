How you and your partner define their needs is crucial to meeting them.

It’s awfully hard to hit a bullseye when you’re aiming at the wrong target. You might luck up and hit it. But it’s a way more efficient plan to first identify and aim (define) at what you’re trying to hit.

It’s not hard to take for granted what we think our partners mean when we learn about their needs. Do we actually understand them correctly, though?

A rupture or disconnection can happen when we make assumptions. And our egos often get in the way of we’re already putting in effort but we’re not recognized or appreciated.

If we remain curious about our partners and clarify how they define having their needs met, we have a much better chance to hit what we’re shooting for.

Aim wisely, my friends.
